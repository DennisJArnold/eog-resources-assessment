## Create React App Visualization
This assessment was bespoke handcrafted for dennisarnold.

## Run the Application
Clone repository <br />
yarn install <br />
yarn build <br />
serve -s build <br />
open http://localhost:5000  <br />

## Future Developments
-Initial Query for past 30 minutes of data. It currently only displays data that has been recieved while the app is running <br />
-Proper scaling of Y-axis for multiple ranges of values <br />
-Multiple Y-axis displaying different degrees of magnitude. (I did have multiple Y-Axis showing at one point, but without the graph scaling properly, I was quite unhappy with the way they looked) <br />
-More clarity on tooltip for units of measure on each line graph <br />
-More clarity on buttons for which metrics are selected <br />
-Time/space complexity optimizations <br />
-Add alerts for data values that fall outside 'Normal range' for each metric <br />

## My Experience With This Project
This was a fun assessment! It was quite challenging to begin with as it was my first real project using typescript, redux, and GraphQL but I loved the opportunity to get more familiar with these tools. There were definitely some choices I made towards less elegant solutions due to my unfamiliarity, and opted for a solution I knew how to implement without further research. I definitely look forward to becoming more familiar with Typescript, Redux, and GraphQL and revisiting this project.
